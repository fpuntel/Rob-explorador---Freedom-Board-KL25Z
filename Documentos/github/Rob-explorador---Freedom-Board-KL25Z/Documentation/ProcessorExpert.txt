Module "AS1"       (component Serial_LDD)
   - AS1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - AS1_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts vectors, 
                etc.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. Method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_ReceiveBlock -Specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified number of 
                characters is received. Method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive operation.

Module "TRIG"      (component BitIO_LDD)
   - TRIG_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.

   - TRIG_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - TRIG_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - TRIG_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).

Module "MQX1"      (component MQXLite)
   - MQX1__int_default_isr -Default ISR that MQX calls if an unhandled interrupt or exception occurs.
   - MQX1__int_disable -The function _int_disable() disables all hardware interrupts at priorities up to and including the MQX 
                disable-interrupt level. As a result, no task can interrupt the active task while the active task is running 
                until interrupts are re-enabled with _int_enable(). If the active task blocks while interrupts are disabled, 
                the state of the interrupts (disabled or enabled) depends on the interrupt-disabled state of the next task that 
                MQX makes ready.
   - MQX1__int_enable -The function _int_enable() resets the processor priority to the hardware priority that corresponds to 
                the active task’s software priority.
   - MQX1__int_exception_isr -To provide support for exception handlers, applications can use this ISR to replace the default 
                ISR. The ISR is specific to the PSP.   An application calls _int_install_exception_isr() to install 
                _int_exception_isr().   The function _int_exception_isr() does the following:   If an exception occurs when a 
                task is running and a task exception ISR exists, MQX runs the ISR;   If a task exception ISR does not exist, 
                MQX aborts the task by calling _task_abort().   If an exception occurs when an ISR is running and an ISR 
                exception ISR exists, MQX aborts the   running ISR and runs the ISR’s exception ISR.   The function walks the 
                interrupt stack looking for information about the ISR or task that was   running before the exception occurred. 
                If the function determines that the interrupt stack contains   incorrect information, it calls 
                _mqx_fatal_error() with error code MQX_CORRUPT_INTERRUPT_STACK.
   - MQX1__int_get_default_isr -Gets a pointer to the default ISR that MQX calls when an unexpected interrupt occurs.
   - MQX1__int_get_exception_handler -Gets a pointer to the current ISR exception handler for the vector number.
   - MQX1__int_get_isr -Gets the current ISR for the vector number.
   - MQX1__int_get_isr_depth -Gets the depth of nesting of the current interrupt stack.
   - MQX1__int_get_isr_data -Gets the data that is associated with the vector number.
   - MQX1__int_get_kernel_isr -Gets a pointer to the kernel ISR for the vector number. The kernel ISR depends on the PSP.
   - MQX1__int_get_previous_vector_table -Gets the address of the interrupt vector table that MQX might have created when it 
                started.
   - MQX1__int_get_vector_table -Gets the address of the current interrupt vector table. The function depends on the PSP.
   - MQX1__int_install_default_isr -Installs an application-provided default ISR.
   - MQX1__int_install_kernel_isr -Installs the kernel ISR. The kernel ISR depends on the PSP.   Some real-time applications 
                need special event handling to occur outside the scope of MQX. The need   might arise that the latency in 
                servicing an interrupt be less than the MQX interrupt latency. If this is the   case, an application can use 
                _int_install_kernel_isr() to bypass MQX and let the interrupt be serviced   immediately.   Because the function 
                returns the previous kernel ISR, applications can temporarily install an ISR or chain   ISRs so that each new 
                one calls the one installed before it.   A kernel ISR must save the registers that it needs and must service 
                the hardware interrupt. When the kernel   ISR is finished, it must restore the registers and perform a 
                return-from-interrupt instruction.   A kernel ISR cannot call MQX functions. However, it can put data in global 
                data, which a task can access.
   - MQX1__int_install_isr -Installs the ISR. The application defines the ISR data, which can be a constant or a pointer to a 
                memory block from _mem_alloc().
   - MQX1__int_install_exception_isr -Installs the MQX-provided _int_exception_isr() as the default ISR for unhandled 
                interrupts and exceptions.
   - MQX1__int_install_unexpected_isr -Installs the MQX-provided unexpected ISR, _int_unexpected_isr(), for all interrupts that 
                do not have an application-installed ISR.
   - MQX1__int_kernel_isr -Default kernel ISR that MQX calls to intercept all interrupts.
   - MQX1__int_set_exception_handler -The function sets the exception handler for an ISR. When an exception (unhandled 
                interrupt) occurs while   the ISR is running, MQX calls the exception handler and terminates the ISR.   An 
                application should install _int_exception_isr() as the MQX default ISR.   The returned exception handler is 
                either the default handler or one that the application previously installed   with _int_set_exception_handler().
   - MQX1__int_set_isr_data -Sets the data associated with the interrupt.
   - MQX1__int_set_vector_table -Changes the location of the interrupt vector table.
   - MQX1__int_unexpected_isr -An MQX-provided default ISR for unhandled interrupts. The function depends on the PSP.
   - MQX1__klog_create_at -
   - MQX1__klog_get_interrupt_stack_usage -Gets the size of the interrupt stack and the total amount of it used.
   - MQX1__klog_get_task_stack_usage -Gets the size of the interrupt stack and the total amount of it used.   The amount used 
                is a highwater mark—the highest amount of interrupt stack that the application has used   so far. It shows only 
                how much of the stack has been written to at this point. If the amount is 0, the interrupt   stack is not large 
                enough.
   - MQX1__klog_control -Controls logging in kernel log.   The application must first create kernel log with _klog_create().   
                The function _klog_control() sets or clears bits in the kernel log control variable, which MQX uses to   
                control logging. To select which functions to log, set combinations of bits in the   KLOG_FUNCTIONS_ENABLED 
                flag for the bit_mask parameter.   MQX logs to kernel log only if KLOG_ENABLED is set in bit_mask.
   - MQX1__klog_disable_logging_task -Disables kernel logging for the task.   If the application calls _klog_control() with 
                KLOG_TASK_QUALIFIED, it must call   _klog_enable_logging_task() for each task for which it wants to log 
                information.   The application disables logging by calling _klog_disable_logging_task() for each task for which 
                it wants   to stop logging. If the application did not first enable logging for the task, MQX ignores the 
                request.
   - MQX1__klog_display -Displays the oldest entry in kernel log and delete the entry.   The function prints the oldest entry 
                in kernel log to the default output stream of the current task and deletes the entry.
   - MQX1__klog_enable_logging_task -Enables kernel logging for the task.   If the application calls _klog_control() with 
                KLOG_TASK_QUALIFIED, it must call   _klog_enable_logging_task() for each task for which it wants to log 
                information.   The application disables logging by calling _klog_disable_logging_task() for each task for which 
                it wants   to stop logging. If the application did not first enable logging for the task, MQX ignores the 
                request.
   - MQX1__klog_show_stack_usage -Displays the amount of interrupt stack used and the amount of stack used by each task.   The 
                function displays the information on the standard output stream for the calling task.

   - MQX1__mem_zero -Fills the region of memory with 0x0.
   - MQX1__mem_test_and_set -Tests and sets a memory location.   The function can be used to implement mutual exclusion between 
                tasks. If the single-addressable unit was 0, the function sets the high bit. If possible, the function uses a 
                bus-cycle indivisible instruction.
   - MQX1__mqx_exit -Terminate the MQX application and return to the environment that started the application.
   - MQX1__mqx_fatal_error -Indicates that an error occurred that is so severe that MQX or the application can no longer

                simple counter, whose size depends on the CPU.
   - MQX1__mqx_set_cpu_type -The function sets CPU_TYPE in kernel data. The MQX Host Tools family of products uses CPU type. 
                CPU types begin with PSP_CPU_TYPE_ and are defined in source\\psp\\cpu_family\\cpu_family.h.
   - MQX1__mqx_set_exit_handler -Sets the address of the MQX exit handler, which MQX calls when it exits.
   - MQX1__sched_get_max_priority -Gets the maximum priority that a task can be.
   - MQX1__sched_get_min_priority -Gets the minimum priority that an application task can be.
   - MQX1__sched_yield -Puts the active task at the end of its ready queue. The function effectively performs a timeslice. If 
                there are no other tasks in this ready queue, the task continues to be the active task.
   - MQX1__task_abort -Makes a task run its task exit handler and then destroys itself.
   - MQX1__task_block -Blocks the active task. The function removes the active task from the task’s ready queue and sets the 
                BLOCKED bit in the STATE field of the task descriptor. The task does not run again until another task 
                explicitly makes it ready with _task_ready().
   - MQX1__task_check_stack -Determines whether the stack for the active task is currently out of bounds.   The function 
                indicates whether the stack is currently past its limit. The function does not indicate whether the stack 
                previously passed its limit.
   - MQX1__task_create_at -Creates the task with the stack location specified
   - MQX1__task_destroy -Destroys the task.   The function does the following for the task being destroyed:   Frees memory 
                resources that the task allocated with functions from the _mem and _partition   families.   Closes all queues 
                that the task owns and frees all the queue elements.   Frees any other component resources that the task owns.
   - MQX1__task_disable_fp -Disables floating-point context switching for the active task if the   task is a floating-point 
                task.
   - MQX1__task_enable_fp -Enables floating-point context switching for the active task.
   - MQX1__task_get_creator -Gets the task ID of the task that created the calling task.
   - MQX1__task_get_environment -Gets a pointer to the application-specific environment data for the task.
   - MQX1__task_get_exception_handler -Gets a pointer to the task exception handler.
   - MQX1__task_get_error -Sets the task error code.   MQX uses the function to indicate an error. MQX never sets the task 
                error code to MQX_OK; that is, MQX   does not reset the task error code. It is the responsibility of the 
                application to reset the task error code.   As a result, when an application calls _task_get_error(), it gets 
                the first error that MQX detected since the   last time the application reset the task error code.

                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - P3_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - P3_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "P4"        (component BitIO)
   - P4_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - P4_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - P4_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - P4_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - P4_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "SS1"       (component SPISlave_LDD)
   - SS1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SS1_Deinit -This method deinitializes the device. It switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, 
                interrupts vectors, etc.
   - SS1_SendBlock -This method sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission 
                is not completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation.
   - SS1_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation.
   - SS1_GetSentDataNum -Returns the number of sent characters. This method is available only if method SendBlock is enabled.
   - SS1_GetReceivedDataNum -Returns the number of received characters in the receive buffer. This method is available only if 
                the ReceiveBlock method is enabled.

Module "TRIG2"     (component BitIO_LDD)
   - TRIG2_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - TRIG2_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts 
                vectors, etc.
   - TRIG2_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - TRIG2_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - TRIG2_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - TRIG2_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - TRIG2_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
